# Reddit Comments Dataset

This is a set of comments scraped from posts on Reddit. Top level comments were saved from the fifty top subreddits by subscriber count. (as of April of 2020) There are a maximum of hundred comments saved from the maximum of the top 1000 posts.

The comments are in separate `.txt` files by subreddit. There are two separate `.txt` files included, one of them has data on each of the files, (word count, character count) the other one has a list of all subreddits formatted as a Python list, for easy use.
